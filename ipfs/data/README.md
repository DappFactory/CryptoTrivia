# Quiz Datasets

Here, we download quiz game datasets and then parse into an acceptable csv format that is easily uploadable to IPFS.

## Raw Formats
These can be in .txt files, .csv files, etc.

But they are parsed into a .csv file that is formatted correctly

## Usage
Change the python filepath for the parser.py file and run it.

    python parser.py

## Tests
We use pytest as a testing suite to test all parsing functionality before releasing it as code that is automatically run on new quiz datasets.

## Datasets:
1. Simple Trivia Quiz Game
